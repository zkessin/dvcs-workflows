== Using HG

While GIT is the major DVCS in use Murcuial (also known as hg) is also
being used by a number of projects. In many cases the basic ideas of
git and HG are pretty similar, so if you have been using one switching
to the other should not require much of a learning curve.

NOTE: HG is the chemical symbol for mercury, so that is the short
name. All those of you who remember high school or college chemistry
class knew that. 

There are of course a number of technical differences in the internal
workings of git and HG but they are beyond the scope of this book as I
really want to focus on how to effectively use these tools to get work
done. How the internals work are not really important, if you care of
course then there are a number of books, videos and web sites that
will cover how the internals work. That being said you can use both
tools with out knowing how they index data internal. 

To create a repository in HG create a directory and use the command
+hg init+. This will create an empty hg repository to which we can add
files.

Most of the commands to work with HG are pretty similar to GIT. So you
can add files with +hg add file* or commit with +hg commit " and so
on. 

=== Sharing HG Repositories 
If we want to share that repository we can run the command +hg serve+
which will open a web server on port 8000 which we can use the
interact with the hg repository. 

The +hg serve+ command will produce a web page that looks a bit like
the following image, with a history of the repository.

The nice this about this web page is that for free you get a number of
nice features, that can help you manage a repository. 

If you want to see a graphical version of the network of commits you
can use the graph option which will give you a screen that looks like
this image. Here you can see the results of a repository where there
was a branch and a merge. With the side branch in green.

NOTE: run +hg serve+ will by default not run in the background but
keep logging to the terminal, so run it on a spare tab on in a session
with screen or tmux or the like.

You can also use the server to clone a repository by simply typing +hg
clone URL+ which will pull the changes. 

In terms of how to add files, like in git you use +hg add <files>+
followed by +hg commit+ and like in git the +-m+ option will let you
set the commit message.

If you made some changes that you don't want to keep you can use the
+hg revert <files>+ to roll one or more files back to the last
commit. When you do this hg will save any files you rolled back with
the ending +.orig+ so that they are not lost.
