# How to Contribute 

This book is about teams, how they work and how they can work
better. I want to show how different people have used Git or HG to
work with a team. It could be a team of 3000 people or of 3. If you
have used Git and had a good experience that you think others could
benefit from I want to hear from you. 

If you had a bad experience with git that is also valuable. Please
feel free to write that up too and include it with the word "Anti
Pattern" in the title.

## Getting started 

This book is written in
[asciidoc](http://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc). If you have never used
Asciidoc it is similar to markdown but with some differences. You can
find a cheat sheet at the link. 

If you want to document your workflow you should create a new file in
the "workflows" directory. It should follow the model of the files
that are already there. It should start with the name of the workflow
and then contain the table that shows what kind of group and project
you used this workflow for.

You should also add a the following line to as the second line of the
file

````
=== Workflow by <your name here>
````

Once you have done that add a link to the last line of the
workflows.asciidoc document and send a pull request to user "zkessin"


## Things that need doing

There are a number of sections that need improving, if you want to
write something here is a list of what needs doing.  

Other sections that need expanding are marked with the word "TODO"

* Tortoise GIT & HG in Graphical git
