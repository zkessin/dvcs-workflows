= DVCS Work flows

Collaboration is the key to successful projects. But creating  an
effective collaboration is knowing how to integrate the contributions
of team members. 

There are many aspects to building a great collaboration, good people,
good tools, and good procedures. The people part is the subject for
other works but the tools and procedures will be covered here. 

The tools are Git and GitHub or Mercurial (HG). 

In the last few years many developers have moved from old style
version control systems like CVS and SVN to new Distributed Version
Control Systems like HG and GIT. Which offer a lot more power and
flexibility for development teams. 

When using SVN (or CVS) there is really only one work flow that can be
used. Everyone checks in to one central repository and every commit is
exposed to every developer. Thus it is impossible to check in partial
work without risking *Breaking the Build*. In addition branches are a
pain to use.

However in making this transition many teams have not realized that
there are many ways to setup a team work flow with a DVCS system. This
book aims to explore some of those setups and explain why they work or
don't work for that team.


== Building this Book

You can find this book online at
http://zkessin.github.com/dvcs-workflows[]. The version there should
track the master branch here. 

If you wish to build the book from the asciidoc sources install
asciidoc and run this command

........................................
asciidoc --backend=html5 --out-file=book.html toc.asciidoc
........................................


This ebook may eventually turn into a real book of some form. 


== Contributing your Experience 

If your team has done something different from what I have documented
here and you would like to contribute what you have done please write
it up and send a pull request. If your work flow did not work well for
your team please write it up anyway with why it didn't work so others
can learn from your experience.

Also please include your name, project or organization and as much
detail as you can.

Work flows should start with this table as a guide for readers. You
can copy the markup from the source of this file.
